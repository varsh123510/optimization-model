**DESCRIPTION OF THE TASK **

Optimization Model Description
The optimization model you're working with is a Linear Programming (LP) model. Linear programming is used to find the best outcome (e.g., maximum profit, minimum cost) subject to a set of constraints. Let's break down the components of this model in detail:

1. Decision Variables:
The decision variables represent the quantities of the products to be produced. These are the variables you are trying to determine or "optimize" in order to maximize your profit.

x1: Number of units of Product A to be produced.
x2: Number of units of Product B to be produced.
Both variables are continuous, meaning they can take any non-negative real values (e.g., 2.5 units of Product A or 3.75 units of Product B). The lower bound for both variables is set to 0, meaning you cannot produce a negative number of units.

2. Objective Function:
The objective function is the formula you're trying to either maximize or minimize. In this case, you want to maximize the profit.

Profit from Product A: For each unit of Product A produced, you earn $30.
Profit from Product B: For each unit of Product B produced, you earn $40.
The objective function, therefore, is:

Where:

30x

​
  is the total profit from Product A.
40
𝑥

40x

​
  is the total profit from Product B.
3. Constraints:
Constraints are the restrictions or limitations on the decision variables. These ensure that the solution meets real-world limits, such as available labor, materials, or budget. In this case, there are two constraints:

Labor Constraint:
The total labor required to produce the products cannot exceed the available labor hours.

Product A: It takes 2 hours of labor to produce each unit of Product A.
Product B: It takes 1 hour of labor to produce each unit of Product B.
So, the labor constraint is:

2
𝑥

𝑥

​

​
 ≤40
This ensures that the total labor used for both products (2 hours for each unit of Product A and 1 hour for each unit of Product B) does not exceed 40 hours.

Material Constraint:
The total amount of material used for both products cannot exceed the available material.

Product A: It takes 1 unit of material to produce each unit of Product A.
Product B: It takes 2 units of material to produce each unit of Product B.
So, the material constraint is:

𝑥
1

𝑥

This ensures that the total material used for both products (1 unit per Product A and 2 units per Product B) does not exceed 30 units of material.

5. Interpretation of the Model:
This model is essentially a profit-maximization problem where you want to determine how many units of two products (Product A and Product B) to produce in order to achieve the highest possible profit, while respecting the constraints imposed by limited resources (labor and material).

Objective: Maximize profit by producing a combination of Product A and Product B.
Labor Constraint: You have a limited number of labor hours, so the total labor used in producing both products cannot exceed 40 hours.
Material Constraint: You also have a limited amount of material, so the total material required to produce both products cannot exceed 30 units.
Non-negativity: You cannot produce a negative number of products, so both 
𝑥
1
x 
1
​
  and 
𝑥
2
x 
2
​
  must be greater than or equal to zero.
6. Optimization Process:
To solve this linear programming problem, an optimization solver (like the one in your code) uses mathematical algorithms to find the values of 
𝑥
1
x 
1
​
  (Product A) and 
𝑥
2
x 
2
​
  (Product B) that maximize the profit while respecting the constraints.

After solving, the solver will return:

The optimal number of units of Product A and Product B to produce.
The maximum profit achievable with those quantities.
Any additional insights into how the resources are being utilized.
Summary of the Optimization Model:
Objective: Maximize profit, where the profit from Product A is $30 per unit, and the profit from Product B is $40 per unit.
Decision Variables: 
𝑥

​
  (units of Product A) and 
𝑥

​
  (units of Product B).
Constraints:
The total labor hours used (2 hours per unit of Product A and 1 hour per unit of Product B) cannot exceed 40 hours.
The total amount of material used (1 unit per unit of Product A and 2 units per unit of Product B) cannot exceed 30 units.
Goal: Find the values of 
𝑥
